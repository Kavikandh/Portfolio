**About Me:**
I am a data analytics professional with demonstrated records of converting large data sets (500K+ records) into quantifiable business deliverables. I focus on using analytics, data engineering theory, and business intelligence to stimulate the revenue growth, efficiency, and strategic decisions.
I have a solid background in the end-to-end data processes, i.e. data extraction and transformation to advanced analytics and executive-level reporting, but with an emphasis on developing scalable, insight-driven applications.
